Live-wire is an open-source implementation of scaled down version of a Push server.

The idea is to support the following three types of channels:

(1) lw-presence for peer availability.
(2) lw-private for multicasting of events to a specified group of authorized peers, and
(3) lw-public for less secure and open channel type.

Note: It is not fully implemented. Work in progress.
